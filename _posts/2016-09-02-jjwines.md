  We quickly inquired about the ad and set up a vineyard visit. Upon our first
  visit to Appian Way, we knew we had found our match. Appian Way is a small,
  2.5-acre vineyard planted to 100% Pinot Noir with 3 different clones including
  Dijon clones 115 and 777 as well as Pommard, a Heritage clone.
