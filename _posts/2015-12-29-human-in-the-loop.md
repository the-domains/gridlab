At the core, humans are needed to drive the AI, drive the direction and the vision for each persons unique slice of the internet.

In the meantime here are some key changes in approach that I have already noticed in the last twelve months. 

* The designer workload is not reduced. It is refocused. Time is saved from menial tasks and applied directly to efforts of significance and value to the project in hand. 
* A healthy acceptance to giving up absolute control of the output. Not to be confused with compromise or total control. Nor pixel perfection. 
* There is less focus on a traditional website "page" and more focus on the elements, components and sections that come together to make up these pages. Ultimately, a purer focus on the content and how it leads design. 
* Strengths in relationships between elements, components and sections are much more important to be explicitly expressed. Are they required, strong or weak --- just like in[GSS][0]. Think beyond media queries, break points and viewports. It became more granular and focused around the content. 
* The ability to articulate and communicate design intention in an algorithmic way is essential. This stems more from the ability to understand why you design the way you do, not the ability to code. Those colours, typefaces, grids, white-space, layout --- keep asking yourself "why?". 
* A deeper understanding of colour, type, geometry; in fact all aspects of design and how they impact human emotion, mood and reactions are hugely beneficial. 
* Focus and foresight are needed in the constraints we use, guide and provide. Understand the ripples you create with edits, additions and changes. These ripples become the foundations on which we scale design exponentially.
* Perceived small tweaks i.e. change in typeface, can cause the most drastic change in tone and mood conveyed. Be purposeful and extremely selective. 
* A mind shift in providing systems beyond sets (or absolute values) for colour, type, grids, shape, affordance, icons et al. 

Fundamentally we are providing a solution, not a result. A framework not a static site. A guideline not a rulebook.

A way to deliver music that feels magical, to the masses.
Yes, the approach is different, the focus is different, it is a paradigm shift beyond the norm of today. To alter our approach and focus is no small feat yet the potential is once again exciting, intoxicating and full of possibilities.

At the heart of it though, it is still human-centred; by humans for humans. The potential with assistive AI is that together we can raise the bar for everyone online --- not just for the select few that can.
