# Entropic Design

> **_entropic _**adjective  
> 1\._The definition of entropic is having a tendency to change from a state of order to a state of disorder._

Here is a quick glimpse into the design process as it is today.

Firstly, when starting out designing a site that adapts to content there is an obvious area lacking --- the content. Traditionally you establish the content up front in order to direct the design and presentation. Without it the possibilities and permutations are endless.

We have deep dived into the potential permutations of content types; small text, large text, titles, subtitles, video, imagery, media and all the combinations that are possible by mixing a few or all the elements together. It is both laborious and seemingly endless.

This is what many of the design frameworks, themes and UI kits provide, to an extent, today. A laborious list of workable templates that can accommodate content in a presentable fashion. Unique, unorthodox or unexpecting content then has to be retro-fitted which then quickly starts shaping sites that look 'samey'.

> The focus is in the wrong area. Currently we focus on containers for design. Not the forces that drive the design.

This shift in focus revealed that a few fundamental laws and adding more and more constraints can produce remarkable results. Yet, still accommodate more unforeseen permutations that is simply not available with current design kits or design frameworks.

When designing for a site like [thegrid.io][0] there is still the same job of generating a lot of mockups but there is a big difference in intention. They are not meant for replication or colour by number in developers

Firstly, the designs are purely for the purpose of research and development. A communication and investigation tool to extrapolate the core fundamentals and highlight the constraints implicitly being applied to the designs.

Secondly, there is a job of articulating those fundamentals, intentions and constraints into a format that the AI can understand. We translate design intention into an algorithmic format that can then be used to generate desired outputs based upon highlighted constraints.

We channel the designs using [GSS (Grid Style Sheets][1]) to produce thousands of variations of content presentations based on the combinations of our explicit constraints. Producing in minutes what a single designer could do in, at best, months.

Thirdly, for the designer, there is an art direction phase of looking through the output generated. There is an inevitable move from low to high entropy as we generate thousands of variations. However, we can add more constraints again to mark which outputs are required, which are strong and which are weak. Over time, this process becomes more and more refined letting the best presentations bubble to the surface.

Lastly, we take our findings and feed that back into the AI; adding more constraints, more refinement and more polish until we are left with a layout filter that can accommodate more content types and variation than any UI kit could offer.

> The job of the designer and developer are not going away. They are evolving, adapting and changing to become even more relevant to the unique requirements and needs of every individual.
