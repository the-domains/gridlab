  In Dave Arnold's laboratory on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, you'll find
  cylinders of liquid nitrogen and a fold-up bike on the floor; wide-ranging
  books and liquor bottles on the walls; and an unruly workshop in the basement,
  where he experiments under the auspices of his food science development
  company, Booker and Dax Lab.
